My lab homework in data structure class

# intro
I decided to convert my chaos code into some tidy staffs, and deal them with some modularity thinking.
Then I designed some header files and .c files, and moved lab5(binary tree's construction & level-order traverse)'s code into my design.
The first code will be lab5 now.
